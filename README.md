# my-vim-setting
Personal use vim setting for fast configuration when I have to create a vim environment on a new server. 

## Usage
First give the `setup.sh` script permission
```shell
chmod 755 setup.sh
```
Then run it
```shell
./setup.sh
```


## Scheme

The color scheme I use is [vim-code-dark-master](https://github.com/tomasiser/vim-code-dark). I have include all its source file and they would be copy to `~/.vim` once you run `./setup.sh`. 

## Plugin

 [auto-pairs.vim](https://github.com/jiangmiao/auto-pairs) (inserts or deletes brackets, parens, quotes in pairs)

 [endwise.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-endwise) (in Ruby, adds `end` after `if`, `do`, `def`, etc.)

## How to learn vim

Enter the following command on your shell

```shell
vimtutor
```

That's it! Do it multiple times:)
